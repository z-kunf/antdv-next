```

1. `file` File object for the current operation.

      uid: 'uid',      // unique identifier, negative is recommended, // to prevent interference with internally generated id
      name: 'xx.png',   // file name
      status: 'done' | 'uploading' | 'error' | 'removed', // Intercepted file by beforeUpload doesn't have a status field.
      response: '{"status": "success"}', // response from server
      linkProps: '{"download": "image"}', // additional HTML props of file link
      xhr: 'XMLHttpRequest{ ... }', // XMLHttpRequest Header
   }
   ```

2. `fileList` current list of files

3. `event` response from the server, including uploading progress, supported by advanced browsers.

### AcceptObject {#acceptobject}

## FAQ

### How do I implement upload server side? {#faq-server-implement}

- You can consult [jQuery-File-Upload](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki#server-side) about how to implement server side upload interface.
- There is a mock example of [express](https://github.com/react-component/upload/blob/211979fdaa2c7896b6496df7061a0cfc0fc5434e/server.js) in rc-upload.

### I want to display download links. {#faq-show-download-link}

Please set property `url` of each item in `fileList` to control the content of the link.

### How to use `customRequest`? {#faq-custom-request}

See <https://github.com/react-component/upload#customrequest>.

### Why will the `fileList` that's in control not trigger `onChange` `status` update when the file is not in the list? {#faq-filelist-controlled-status}

`onChange` will only trigger when the file is in the list, it will ignore any events removed from the list.

### Why does `onChange` sometimes return File object and other times return `{ originFileObj: File }`? {#faq-on-change-return-type}

For compatible case, we return File object when `beforeUpload` return `false`. It will merge to `{ originFileObj: File }` in the next major version. Current version is compatible to get origin file by `info.file.originFileObj`. You can change this before a major release.

### Why sometimes Chrome can not upload? {#faq-chrome-file-picker}

Chrome update will also break native upload. Please restart Chrome to finish the upload job.

### Can still select files when uploading a folder in Safari? {#faq-safari-folder-upload}

Inside the upload component, we use the `directory` and `webkitdirectory` properties to control the input to implement folder selection, but it seems that in Safari's implementation, [it doesn't prevent users from selecting files](https://stackoverflow.com/q/55649945/3040605). You can solve this issue through `accept` configuration, for example:

```ts
accept = {
  // Do not allow selecting any files
  format: `.${'n'.repeat(100)}`,
  // Accept all files within the folder after folder selection
  filter: () => true,
}
```
